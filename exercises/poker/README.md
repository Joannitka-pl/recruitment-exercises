Ruby: 2.1.3+ (feel free to use any ruby version you want)

```
rvm use 2.1.3@conundrum --create
gem install rspec
gem install require_all
rspec <insert path to your specs here>
```

Usual tasks:

- Write implementation so all tests are green
- Do not modify tests (sample implementation was written, so test are 99.99% ok and implementable)

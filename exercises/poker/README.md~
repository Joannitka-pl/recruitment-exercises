Ruby: 2.1.3

```
rvm use 2.1.3@conundrum --create
gem install rspec
gem install require_all
rspec spec
```

Usual tasks:

- Download repository contents and upload them again to the new repository of your choice (do not fork)
- Write implementation so all tests are green
- Do not modify tests (sample implementation was written, so test are 99.99% ok and implementable)
- Pay attention to working with repository the right way
